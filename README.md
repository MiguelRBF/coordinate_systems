It also can be useful as a Rosetta Stone (bridge) between different programming languages.

The Rosetta Stone is a stele composed of granodiorite inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences between the three versions, making the Rosetta Stone key to deciphering the Egyptian scripts. [[**1**]](./documents/5_list_references.md)

# Educational purpose

This github repository was created with 2 main goals:

- Helping all the people to understand the different coordinate systems.

- To be a "Rosetta Stone" to understand different programming languages.
